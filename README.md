# memory-cards

![screenshots](/screenshot.png)

Little python software I made while studyng in Uni, for remembering boring biological notions.

You write cards with questions and answers and, during a test session, it shows to you what it thinks is the question that you will most probably fail.
The Q/A will be showed using your default text editor.
After each test you report your performance that will be used for evaluating wich question to ask next and to show you stasts summarizing your progress.
The software also give you the possibility of setting a generic file as a question or answer, e.g. you can set a text as a question and a specific page of a pdf as an answer.
All the info of how to open a file are saved in "Programs.txt".

Admittedly UX is not super user friendly as this software was written for my personal use.
